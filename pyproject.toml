description = "The TaskTonic framework provides powerful, built-in support for concurrency. While it doesn't require you to manage threads, full multi-threading support is available if you need it. Tonics (where a task gets done) are equipped with built-in timers and state machines to help you build complex logic quickly and reliably."
